      <p>Hello there! I am Rayner Tan, and I am an aspiring game developer. My passion lies in the game industry and my dream is to be an Indie game developer.</p>

      <p>Primarily, I am a programmer, but I also have basic Photoshop and Illustrator skills that I use to create simple sprites for the games I make. I have been programming since the age of 13 and started by exploring javascript to create a quadratic formula calculator.</p>

      <p>Since then, I have explored other languages such as Swift/Objective C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, and a couple of web languages such as HTML, CSS, and php. I have experience making games and applications using Unity Engine, Xcode, and Eclipse.</p>

      <p>My hobbies include gaming, Chinese Calligraphy, Origami, and collecting. I enjoy collecting nanoblocks, jigsaw puzzles, Lego sets, souvenirs, game art books, game original soundtracks, and plushies. I love exploring technology and have many interests in the field of science as well.</p>
