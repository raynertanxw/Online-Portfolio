        <br>
        <p>Hello there! I am Rayner Tan, I do software development.</p>

        <p>Primarily, I am a programmer, but I also have basic Photoshop and Illustrator skills that I use to create simple sprites for the games and software I make. Having learnt 3D modelling in Autodesk Maya in a school module, I have also started making basic 3D assets (I can use Blender as well). I have been programming since the age of 13, and started out by exploring javascript to create a quadratic formula calculator.</p>

        <p>Since then, I have explored other languages such as Swift/Objective C, C++, C#, Java, and a couple of web languages such as HTML, CSS, and php. I also have experience in making games and applications using Unity Game Engine and Xcode.</p>

        <p>I've worked as a full-time game programmer for LandShark Games Pte. Ltd. during which I designed and built a reusable client-server caching system, established Unity iOS build pipelines, writing various tools and plugins. I also worked on many systems including asset management enhancements, debug tools and environments, new gameplay features, etc.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include reading, cooking, gaming, fountain pens, Chinese calligraphy, origami, and collecting things! I enjoy collecting nanoblocks, jigsaw puzzles, Lego sets, souvenirs, game art books, game original soundtracks, and plushies.</p>

        <p>I am also a huge food lover and enjoy scenic views such as those of Yosemite, and the beautiful Sakura trees during full bloom in Shinjuku Gyoen. I love travelling and seeing sights. But I also enjoy time alone reflecting, pondering, and journaling.</p>
