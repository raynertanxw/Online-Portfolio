      <p>I always liked to create small lists in a daily todo format. It helped me stay organised and I felt great checking off a task on paper. But I could never find an app simple enough for just this one thing. So I decided to make my own.</p>

      <p>Just List It is as simple as it gets. Designed to mimic a clipboard or small notebook where you list down simple checklists of tasks that you want to focus on each day. You only see tasks one day at a time, giving you complete focus. No need to set reminders, etc. Just list it into the day and get it done. Simple yet effective.</p>

      <p>This was my first published project since coming back from my two year church mission doing volunteer work. It was a challenge to myself to get back to publishing things. I wanted to push myself to learn SwiftUI, CoreData, CloudKit, and StoreKit. I made this app mostly in between train rides to and fro my internship office.</p>

      <p>The idea came about as I was working on a much bigger project for a daily and weekly planner organiser inspired from the one I used on my mission (which was called AreaBook). I wanted something simplier and also wanted to digitize my clipboard checklist that I had but always found cumbersome to bring around. Thus the idea to digitize the checklist clipboard was realised and made into reality.</p>
